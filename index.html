        <div class="content-top">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface breathing gas supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance.[1] The name scuba is an anacronym for "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus" and was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater than free divers.</div>
        <div class="content-bottom">Although the use of compressed air is common, a gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched air or nitrox, has become popular due to the reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. Also, breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce the effects of nitrogen narcosis during deeper dives.</div>

            <div class="content-left">Fethiye, in the Mediterranean, offers diverse diving experiences. It is combined with underwater exploration with rich marine life, ancient ruins, and clear Mediterranean waters. Butterfly Valley and the Blue Cave are among the notable sites, with opportunities to see colorful fish and underwater formations. Fethiye is an ideal destination for diving throughout the diving season, typically from April to November.</div>
            <div class="content-center">Marmaris, another popular destination on the Aegean coast, offers various diving locations. Sites like Paradise Island and Pineapple Bay provide rich underwater landscapes. Marmaris offers a rich array of marine life—species like fish schools, damselfish, sea breams, and barracudas. Moray eels, octopuses, and seahorses are common sightings. The diving season typically runs from April to November</div>
            <div class="content-right">Located on the Mediterranean coast, Kaş and Kalkan are popular diving spots. The area features crystal-clear waters, underwater caves, and a variety of marine life—species like damselfish, wrasses, and sea breams. Larger marine species, such as barracudas and groupers, are common sightings</div>
